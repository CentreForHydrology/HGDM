Linkages between the controls on surface storage and catchment streamflow response were examined in a wetland-dominated basin in the Canadian Prairie Pothole region. Snowmelt, surface storage, water table elevation, atmospheric fluxes, and streamflow were monitored during spring snowmelt and summer in a 1km\textbackslash textlesssup\textbackslash textgreater2\textbackslash textless/sup\textbackslash textgreater sub-catchment containing a semi-permanent pond complex connected via an intermittent stream. Snow accumulation in the basin in the spring of the 2013 study year was the largest in the 24-year record. Rainfall totals in 2013 were close to the long term average, although June was an anomalously wet month. The water budget of the pond complex indicates that there was a significant subsurface contribution to surface storage. Activation of an effective transmission zone occurred between uplands and the stream network where the water table was located near the ground surface, which allowed significant lateral movement of subsurface water into the stream network. This was also important for maintaining and re-establishing surface connectivity and streamflow during rainfall events. The observed period of surface-water connectivity was one of the longest on record in the catchment due to unusually wet conditions; nevertheless, the results of this study have implications for how contributing area and runoff should be considered in monitoring and modelling studies in the region, as inclusion of more frequent and varied runoff processes will be essential to understanding changing streamflow regimes.},

  abstract = {The Cold Regions Hydrological Modelling plat- form (CRHM) was used to create a prairie hydrological model for Smith Creek Research Basin ({$\sim$}400km2), east- central Saskatchewan, Canada. Physically based modules were sequentially linked in CRHM to simulate snow pro- cesses, frozen soils, variable contributing area and wetland storage and runoff generation. Five ``representative basins'' (RBs) were defined and each was divided into seven hydro- logical response units (HRUs): fallow, stubble, grassland, river channel, open water, woodland, and wetland. Model parameters were estimated using field survey data, LiDAR digital elevation model (DEM), SPOT 5 satellite imageries, stream network and wetland inventory GIS data. Model sim- ulations were conducted for 2007/2008 and 2008/2009. No calibration was performed. The model performance in pre- dicting snowpack, soil moisture and streamflow was evalu- ated against field observations. Root mean square differences (RMSD) between simulation and observations ranged from 1.7 to 25.2mm and from 4.3 to 22.4mm for the simulated snow accumulation in 2007/2008 and 2008/2009, respec- tively, with higher RMSD in grassland, river channel, and open water HRUs. Spring volumetric soil moisture was rea- sonably predicted compared to a point observation in a grass- land area, with RMSD of 0.011 and 0.009 for 2008 and 2009 simulations, respectively. The model was able to capture the timing and magnitude of peak spring basin discharge, but it underestimated the cumulative volume of basin discharge by 32\% and 56\% in spring 2008 and 2009, respectively. The re- sults suggest prediction of Canadian Prairie basin snow hy- drology is possible with no calibration if physically based models are used with physically meaningful model parame- ters that are derived from high resolution geospatial data.},

  abstract = {Small topographic depressions have important functions in hydrology and ecology because they store water in the form of shallow lakes, wetlands or ephemeral ponds. The relations between the area A, the volume V, and the depth h of water in depressions are important for evaluating water and dissolved-mass balances of the system. The A\textendash h and V\textendash h relations are usually determined from fine-resolution elevation maps based on detailed survey data. Simple equations are presented in this paper, which can be used to: (1) interpolate A\textendash h and V\textendash h data points obtained by a detailed survey; (2) approximate unknown A\textendash h and V\textendash h relations of a depression from a minimal set of field data without a time-consuming elevation survey; and (3) serve as a geometric model of depressions in simulation studies. The equations are simple power functions having two constants. The first constant s is related to the size of the depression, and the second constant p is related to the geometry of the depression. The power functions adequately represent A\textendash h and V\textendash h relations of all 27 wetlands and ephemeral ponds examined in this paper, which are situated in the northern prairie region of North America. Assuming that the power functions are applicable for other similar topographic depressions, an observer only needs to measure A and h twice to determine the two constants in the equation. The equations will be useful in field studies requiring approximate A\textendash h and V\textendash h relations and in theoretical and modeling studies. ᭧ 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

  abstract = {The prairie region of Canada and the United States is characterized by millions of small depressions of glacial origin called prairie potholes. The transfer of surface runoff in this landscape is mainly through a "fill and spill" mechanism among neighboring potholes. While non-contributing areas, that is small internally drained basins, are common on this landscape, during wet periods these areas can become hydrologically connected to larger regional drainage systems. Accurate prediction of prairie surface runoff generation and streamflow thus requires realistic representation of the dynamic threshold-mediated nature of these contributing areas. This paper presents a new prairie surface runoff generation algorithm for land surface schemes and large scale hydrological models that conceptualizes a hydrologic unit as a combination of variable and interacting storage elements. The proposed surface runoff generation algorithm uses a probability density function to represent the spatial variation of pothole storages and assumes a unique relationship between storage and the fractional contributing area for runoff (and hence amount of direct runoff generated) within a grid cell. In this paper the parameters that define this relationship are obtained by calibration against streamflow. The model was compared to an existing hydrology-land surface scheme (HLSS) applied to a typical Canadian prairie catchment, the Assiniboine River. The existing configuration is based on the Canadian Land Surface Scheme (CLASS) and WATROF (a physically-based overland and interflow scheme). The new configuration consists of CLASS coupled with the new PDMROF model. Results showed that the proposed surface runoff generation algorithm performed better at simulating streamflow, and appears to capture the dynamic nature of contributing areas in an effective and parsimonious manner. A pilot evaluation based on 1m LiDAR data from a small (10km2) experimental area suggests that the shape of the modeled storage-contributing area relationship is broadly consistent with that inferred from terrain analysis, under certain simplifying assumptions. The direct identification of storage-runoff parameters from terrain analysis is an outstanding challenge, and a promising area for future research. \textcopyright{} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {A dry climate, the prevalence of small depressions, and the lack of a well-developed drainage network are characteristics of environments with extremely variable contributing areas to runoff. These types of regions arguably present the greatest challenge to properly understanding catchment streamflow generation processes. Previous studies have shown that contributing area dynamics are important for streamflow response, but the nature of the relationship between the two is not typically understood. Furthermore, it is not often tested how well hydrological models simulate contributing area. In this study, the ability of a semidistributed hydrological model, the PDMROF configuration of Environment Canada's MESH model, was tested to determine if it could simulate contributing area. The study focused on the St. Denis Creek watershed in central Saskatchewan, Canada, which with its considerable topographic depressions, exhibits wide variation in contributing area, making it ideal for this type of investigation. MESH-PDMROF was able to replicate contributing area derived independently from satellite imagery. Daily model simulations revealed a hysteretic relationship between contributing area and streamflow not apparent from the less frequent remote sensing observations. This exercise revealed that contributing area extent can be simulated by a semi-distributed hydrological model with a scheme that assumes storage capacity distribution can be represented with a probability function. However, further investigation is needed to determine if it can adequately represent the complex relationship between streamflow and contributing area that is such a key signature of catchment behavior.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} The Probability Distributed Model, or PDM, has evolved as a toolkit of model functions that together constitute a lumped rainfall-runoff model capable of representing a variety of catchment-scale hydrological behaviours. Runoff production is represented as a saturation excess runoff process controlled by the absorption capacity (of the canopy, surface and soil) whose variability within the catchment is characterised by a probability density function of chosen form. Soil drainage to groundwater is controlled by the water content in excess of a tension threshold, optionally inhibited by the water content of the receiving groundwater store. Alternatively, a proportional split of runoff to fast (surface storage) and slow (groundwater) pathways can be invoked with no explicit soil drainage function. Recursive solutions to the Horton-Izzard equation are provided for routing flows through these pathways, conveniently considered to yield the surface runoff and baseflow components of the total flow. An alternative routing function employs a transfer function that is discretely-coincident to a cascade of two linear reservoirs in series. For real-time flow forecasting applications, the PDM is complemented by updating methods based on error prediction and state-correction approaches. The PDM has been widely applied throughout the world, both for operational and design purposes. This experience has allowed the PDM to evolve to its current form as a practical toolkit for rainfall-runoff modelling and forecasting.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {A drainage basin's runoff response can be determined by the connectivity of generated runoff to the stream network and the connectivity of the downstream drainage network. The connectivity of a drainage basin modulates its ability to produce streamflow and respond to precipitation events and is a function of the complex and variable storage capacities throughout the drainage basin and along the drainage network. An improved means to measure and account for the dynamics of stream network connectivity at the catchment scale is needed to predict basin scale streamflow. At a 150 km2 subarctic Precambrian Shield catchment where the poorly drained heterogeneous mosaic of lakes, exposed bedrock, and soil filled areas creates variable contributing areas, hydrological connectivity was measured in 11 sub-basins with a particular focus on three representative sub-basins. The three sub-basins, although of similar relative size, vary considerably in the dominant typology and topology of their constituent elements. At a 10-m spatial resolution, saturated areas were mapped using both multispectral satellite imagery and onsite measurements of storage according to land cover. To measure basin-scale hydrological connectivity, the drainage network was represented using graph theory where stream reaches are `edges' connecting sub-basin `nodes'. The overall hydrological connectivity of the stream network was described as the ratio of actively flowing relative to potentially flowing stream reaches. The hydrological connectivity of the stream network to the outlet was described as the ratio of actively flowing stream reaches that were connected to the outlet to the potentially flowing stream reaches. Hydrological connectivity was then related to daily average streamflow and basin runoff ratio. Improved understanding of causal factors for the variable streamflow response to runoff generation in this environment will serve as a first step towards improved streamflow prediction in formerly glaciated landscapes, especially in small ungauged basins.

  abstract = {The Canadian Shield landscape includes bedrock uplands and valleys infilled with soil. A site near Yellowknife in subarctic Canada was studied to elucidate the hydrological behaviour of soil-filled valleys. A suite of hydrological processes was found to be important in the studied valley, including snowmelt and rainfall, ground frost development, evaporation, infiltration, lateral inflow from adjacent uplands, and surface and subsurface flows. Valley storage requirements during snowmelt are met by local meltwater infiltration, but lateral inflows in the summer are needed to satisfy the storage before runoff can be generated from the valley. The valleys perform three functions of collecting vertical and lateral water inputs, retaining and losing the water held in storage, and transferring water down the valley and generating local outflow. Unlike channel flows in humid areas, runoff from the upper valley has to meet the storage demands of the lower valley segments, often causing seepage loss along flow paths to render the flows intermittent. A fill-and-spill runoff system is proposed in which the valley physiography results in a series of segments with varying storage conditions. As water is supplied to the valley, each segment has to be filled until its storage threshold for runoff is exceeded. Then, subsurface or surface flows will be generated, but these flows may be arrested to furnish water to satisfy the storage requirements of the segments downstream. Such a flow system applies also to other valleys in the Shield environment. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {We describe a new set of data structures and algorithms for dynamic terrain modeling using a triangulated irregular network (TINs). The framework provides an efficient method for storing, accessing, and updating a Delaunay triangulation and its associated Voronoi diagram. The basic data structure consists of three interconnected data objects: triangles, nodes, and directed edges. Encapsulating each of these geometric elements within a data object makes it possible to essentially decouple the TIN representation from the modeling applications that make use of it. Both the triangulation and its corresponding Voronoi diagram can be rapidly retrieved or updated, making these methods well suited to adaptive remeshing schemes. We develop a set of algorithms for defining drainage networks and identifying closed depressions (e.g., lakes) for hydrologic and geomorphic modeling applications. We also outline simple numerical algorithms for solving network routing and 2D transport equations within the TIN framework. The methods are illustrated with two example applications, a landscape evolution model and a distributed rainfall-runoff model. \# 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},
