  abstract = {The hydrology of the Canadian prairie region is complicated by the existence of numerous land depressions that change the contributing area dynamically and result in a non-linear and hysteretic relationship between contributing area and storage. Depressions are represented conceptually in most hydrologic models as simple storage (bucket) units. These conceptual approaches are simplified and might not adequately represent the dynamics of the depressions and the changing non-contributing area either temporally or spatially, and there\- fore, the simulation of streamflow remains challenging. This study advances a more physically based simulation of the hydrology, streamflow, and spatiotemporal pluvial/nival flooding extents and the associated noncontributing area in the prairies. This is achieved by coupling the MESH hydrology-land surface model with a newly developed surface routing component designed to explicitly deal with the prairie-pothole system (PRIMA) and is referred to as MESH-PRIMA. In this model, MESH handles the classical vertical water and energy balance calculations while PRIMA routes the water over the landscape and quantifies the depressional storage and runoff. The streamflow simulation of MESH-PRIMA is compared against that of MESH with its current conceptual prairie algorithm (MESH-PDMROF) on the Smith Creek Research Basin in Saskatchewan, Canada. MESH-PRIMA shows an improved streamflow and flood simulation compared to MESH-PDMROF and can replicate the non-linear and hysteretic relationship of the basin response. MESH-PRIMA allows for mapping the spatial distribution of water (pluvial/nival flooding) and the non-contributing area over landscape for different events. The results of MESHPRIMA can help in updating the non-contributing area map and in identifying pluvial/nival flooding hazard, which is useful in flooding contexts.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} Calculating flow routing across a landscape is a routine process in geomorphology, hydrology, planetary science, and soil and water conservation. Flow-routing calculations often require a preprocessing step to remove depressions from a DEM to create a ``flow-routing surface'' that can host a continuous, integrated drainage network. However, real landscapes contain natural depressions that trap water. These are an important part of the hydrologic system and should be represented in flow-routing surfaces. Historically, depressions (or ``pits'') in DEMs have been viewed as data errors, but the rapid expansion of high-resolution, high-precision DEM coverage increases the likelihood that depressions are real-world features. To address this long-standing problem of emerging significance, we developed FlowFill, an algorithm that routes a prescribed amount of runoff across the surface in order to flood depressions if enough water is available. This mass-conserving approach typically floods smaller depressions and those in wet areas, integrating drainage across them, while permitting internal drainage and disruptions to hydrologic connectivity. We present results from two sample study areas to which we apply a range of uniform initial runoff depths and report the resulting filled and unfilled depressions, the drainage network structure, and the required compute time. For the reach- to watershed-scale examples that we ran, FlowFill compute times ranged from approximately 1 to 30\&thinsp;min, with compute times per cell of 0.0001 to 0.006\&thinsp;s.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Wetland managers and policy makers need to make decisions based on a sound scientific understanding of hydrological and ecological functions of wetlands. This article presents an overview of the hydrology of prairie wetlands intended for managers, policy makers, and researchers new to this field (e.g., graduate students), and a quantitative conceptual framework for understanding the hydrological functions of prairie wetlands and their responses to changes in climate and land use. The existence of prairie wetlands in the semi-arid environment of the Prairie-Pothole Region (PPR) depends on the lateral inputs of runoff water from their catchments because mean annual potential evaporation exceeds precipitation in the PPR. Therefore, it is critically important to consider wetlands and catchments as highly integrated hydrological units. The water balance of individual wetlands is strongly influenced by runoff from the catchment and the exchange of groundwater between the central pond and its moist margin. Land-use practices in the catchment have a sensitive effect on runoff and hence the water balance. Surface and subsurface storage and connectivity among individual wetlands controls the diversity of pond permanence within a wetland complex, resulting in a variety of eco-hydrological functionalities necessary for maintaining the integrity of prairie-wetland ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Small topographic depressions have important functions in hydrology and ecology because they store water in the form of shallow lakes, wetlands or ephemeral ponds. The relations between the area A, the volume V, and the depth h of water in depressions are important for evaluating water and dissolved-mass balances of the system. The A\textendash h and V\textendash h relations are usually determined from fine-resolution elevation maps based on detailed survey data. Simple equations are presented in this paper, which can be used to: (1) interpolate A\textendash h and V\textendash h data points obtained by a detailed survey; (2) approximate unknown A\textendash h and V\textendash h relations of a depression from a minimal set of field data without a time-consuming elevation survey; and (3) serve as a geometric model of depressions in simulation studies. The equations are simple power functions having two constants. The first constant s is related to the size of the depression, and the second constant p is related to the geometry of the depression. The power functions adequately represent A\textendash h and V\textendash h relations of all 27 wetlands and ephemeral ponds examined in this paper, which are situated in the northern prairie region of North America. Assuming that the power functions are applicable for other similar topographic depressions, an observer only needs to measure A and h twice to determine the two constants in the equation. The equations will be useful in field studies requiring approximate A\textendash h and V\textendash h relations and in theoretical and modeling studies. ᭧ 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

  abstract = {A drainage basin's runoff response can be determined by the connectivity of generated runoff to the stream network and the connectivity of the downstream drainage network. The connectivity of a drainage basin modulates its ability to produce streamflow and respond to precipitation events and is a function of the complex and variable storage capacities throughout the drainage basin and along the drainage network. An improved means to measure and account for the dynamics of stream network connectivity at the catchment scale is needed to predict basin scale streamflow. At a 150 km2 subarctic Precambrian Shield catchment where the poorly drained heterogeneous mosaic of lakes, exposed bedrock, and soil filled areas creates variable contributing areas, hydrological connectivity was measured in 11 sub-basins with a particular focus on three representative sub-basins. The three sub-basins, although of similar relative size, vary considerably in the dominant typology and topology of their constituent elements. At a 10-m spatial resolution, saturated areas were mapped using both multispectral satellite imagery and onsite measurements of storage according to land cover. To measure basin-scale hydrological connectivity, the drainage network was represented using graph theory where stream reaches are `edges' connecting sub-basin `nodes'. The overall hydrological connectivity of the stream network was described as the ratio of actively flowing relative to potentially flowing stream reaches. The hydrological connectivity of the stream network to the outlet was described as the ratio of actively flowing stream reaches that were connected to the outlet to the potentially flowing stream reaches. Hydrological connectivity was then related to daily average streamflow and basin runoff ratio. Improved understanding of causal factors for the variable streamflow response to runoff generation in this environment will serve as a first step towards improved streamflow prediction in formerly glaciated landscapes, especially in small ungauged basins.

  abstract = {Runoff in many locations within the Canadian Prairies is dominated by intermittent fill-and-spill between depressions. As a result, many basins have varying fractions of their areas connected to their outlets, due to changing depressional storage. The objective of this research is to determine the causes of the relationships between water storage and the connected fraction of depression-dominated Prairie basins. It is hypothesized that the shapes of the relationship curves are influenced by both the spatial and frequency distributions of depressional storage. Three sets of numerical experiments are presented to test the hypothesis. The first set of experiments demonstrates that where the number of depressions is small, their size and spatial distributions are important in controlling the relationship between the volume of depressional storage and the connected fraction of a basin. As the number of depressions is increased, the areal fractions of the largest depressions decrease, which reduces the importance of the spatial distribution of depressions. The second set of experiments demonstrates that the curve enveloping the connected fraction of a basin can be derived from the frequency distribution of depression areas, and scaling relationships between the area, volume and catchment area of the depressions, when the area of the largest depression is no greater than approximately 5\% of the total. The third set of experiments demonstrates that the presence of a single large depression can strongly influence the relationship between the depressional storage and the connected fraction of a basin, depending on the relative size of the large depression, and its location within the basin. A single depression containing 30\% of the total depressional area located near the outlet was shown to cause a basin to be nearly endorheic. A similar depression near the top of a basin was demonstrated not to fill and was therefore unable to contribute flows. The implications of the findings for developing hydrological models of large Prairie drainage basins are discussed.},

  abstract = {The Canadian Shield landscape includes bedrock uplands and valleys infilled with soil. A site near Yellowknife in subarctic Canada was studied to elucidate the hydrological behaviour of soil-filled valleys. A suite of hydrological processes was found to be important in the studied valley, including snowmelt and rainfall, ground frost development, evaporation, infiltration, lateral inflow from adjacent uplands, and surface and subsurface flows. Valley storage requirements during snowmelt are met by local meltwater infiltration, but lateral inflows in the summer are needed to satisfy the storage before runoff can be generated from the valley. The valleys perform three functions of collecting vertical and lateral water inputs, retaining and losing the water held in storage, and transferring water down the valley and generating local outflow. Unlike channel flows in humid areas, runoff from the upper valley has to meet the storage demands of the lower valley segments, often causing seepage loss along flow paths to render the flows intermittent. A fill-and-spill runoff system is proposed in which the valley physiography results in a series of segments with varying storage conditions. As water is supplied to the valley, each segment has to be filled until its storage threshold for runoff is exceeded. Then, subsurface or surface flows will be generated, but these flows may be arrested to furnish water to satisfy the storage requirements of the segments downstream. Such a flow system applies also to other valleys in the Shield environment. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},
