`WDPM_10m_all_depressions_area_vol_catchment.csv` - contains depression areas (m^2), volumes (m^2), upland areas (m^2) and total catchment areas (m^2) for all sub-basins at Smith Creek Research Basin (SRCB). The total catchment areas are the sum of the depression areas and the upland areas. The ID number assigned to each depression was used in the processing of the data.

The areas and volumes were obtained by running WDPM (the Wetland DEM Ponding Model) to fill each sub basin, followed by draining all of the excess modelled water. The WDPM runs used a 10m DEM, which was created from the 2m DEM of Annand (2022) which was breached at culvert locations.

The catchment areas were obtained by using a D8 program to determine the depression into which each grid square drains.
